			<h2>Overview</h2>
			<h3>Purpose</h3>
			<p> We have a duty to leave the Earth better than how we found it. As humans, we must do our best to care for our home. My Sustainability site will introduce you into the world of environmental stewardship. 
				In this site, you will find reliable information and resources to help you become a better steward of the Earth. This will range from individual impact, community and cities, and governmental impacts. 
				Our care for the Earth is a moral obligation. </p>
			

			<h3>Audience</h3>
			<p> This is a resource for everyone and anyone to use. We are all inhabitants of this Earth therefore, we are responsible for its upkeep. I strongly encourage everyone to share this with friends and family.  </p>
			

			<h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
			<p> I plan to add a drop down menu, accessible site even on smaller devices, header that stays at the top even when scrolling, and click on my images and expand them. 
				My page will display a list of inspirational environmental quotes, stored as objects in an array. A person can filter quotes by topic (Personal or Global Inspiration). They can click for a random quote.
				Dark/Light mode toggle (with a condition and DOM change). Code is split into ES modules.  </p>

			<h2>Branding</h2>
			<h3>Website Logo</h3>
			<!-- Replace this with some sort of logo for your site.  A logo can be as simple as the name of your site in a nice font :) -->

			<h2>Style Guide</h2>

			<!-- ------------------------Steps 4-8------------------------------ -->

			<h3>Color Palette</h3>
			<!--  The colors you choose for a website are one of the most important decisions you will make. Follow the instructions on the activity in iLearn then return and replace the color codes below with the hex color codes (the 6 digit numbers that show at the bottom of each color) for the colors you have chosen below.  You should have at least 2 colors but do not have to fill in all 4 if you do not need them.  -->

			<!-- Copy and paste the URL to your finished palette below Make sure to paste it into both spots -->
			Palette URL:
			<a
				href="https://coolors.co/396e94-e7c24f-a43312-381d2a-aabd8c"
				target="_blank"

			<table class="colors">
				<tbody>
					<tr>
						<th>Primary</th>
						<th>Secondary</th>
						<th>Accent 1</th>
						<th>Accent 2</th>

					<!-- Replace the numbers in the boxes below with your hex color codes. Then switch to the site-plan.css file and change your colors there as well. -->
					<tr>
						<td class="primary">[#C8E0F4]</td>

						<td class="accent1">[#DDE0BD]</td>

					</tr>

			<h3>Typography</h3>
			I chose the Arial font because it is classic. It is legible and neat. I chose that font for both my heading and paragraphs to instill a sense on uniformity.
			I personally enjoy websites that have the same fonts throughout their pages because typically, colors and features are different. 
			<h4>
				Heading Font: Arial
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h4>
				Paragraph Font: Arial
				<!-- change this -->
			</h4>
			<h3>Normal paragraph example</h3>
			<p>
				Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit, sed do eiusmod
				tempor incididunt ut labore et dolore magna aliqua. Ut enim ad minim
				veniam, quis nostrud exercitation ullamco laboris nisi ut aliquip ex ea
				commodo consequat. Duis aute irure dolor in reprehenderit in voluptate
				velit esse cillum dolore eu fugiat nulla pariatur. Excepteur sint
				occaecat cupidatat non proident, sunt in culpa qui officia deserunt
				mollit anim id est laborum.

			<h3>Colored paragraph example</h3>

			<p> Welcome to Save Our Earth. We have a duty to leave the Earth better than how we found it. As humans, we must do our best to care for our home. 
				This is a moral obligation. Learn about climate change, its causes, and what you can do to help preserve our planet.
				What is Climate Change? Climate change refers to long-term shifts in global temperatures and weather patterns. While natural processes can cause climate fluctuations, current rapid changes are primarily driven by human activities. Learn more at NASA Climate Change.
				Why Climate Change Matters: Climate change affects ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide. Rising temperatures lead to more frequent extreme weather events, loss of biodiversity, and threats to food and water security. The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report provides detailed findings.
				Key Greenhouse Gases: Carbon dioxide (CO₂): Produced by burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industry. Methane (CH₄): Emitted from agriculture, landfills, and fossil fuel extraction.
				Nitrous oxide (N₂O): Released from fertilizers and industrial processes. Fluorinated gases: Synthetic gases used in refrigerants and industry.
				Global Warming Trends: Earth’s average surface temperature has risen about 1.2°C since 1880. Ice sheets are shrinking, sea levels are rising, and extreme heat events are increasing. Data from NASA Global Temperature show the trends.
				Interactive Facts: Here are some important climate facts collected from trusted sources:
				Carbon dioxide levels are higher than in the last 800,000 years (source)
				Global sea levels rose about 8 inches in the last century (source) these will all be hyperlinks 
				Earth’s average temperature has risen by 1.2°C since 1880 (source)

			<h3>[Page 2]</h3>
			<p> The Impact of Climate Change: Explore how climate change affects ecosystems, human health, and economies worldwide.
				Environmental Effects: Rising temperatures cause glaciers to melt, sea levels to rise, and extreme weather events to become more frequent. Coral reefs are bleaching, and habitats for wildlife are shrinking. Learn more at National Geographic.
				Effects on Ecosystems: Species migration or extinction due to habitat loss, Changes in plant flowering and animal breeding cycles, Ocean acidification impacting marine life
				Human Health Risks: Increased heat-related illnesses and deaths, Spread of infectious diseases (e.g., malaria), Food and water shortages affecting nutrition
				Economic Consequences: Extreme weather, flooding, and droughts cause billions in damages annually. Agriculture, fisheries, and tourism are particularly affected. More details at UN Climate Change.
				Global Initiatives & Policies: International agreements like the Paris Agreement aim to limit global warming to well below 2°C. Governments, NGOs, and communities worldwide are implementing renewable energy, reforestation, and sustainable practices.
				How You Can Help: Everyone can make a difference: reduce energy use, recycle, plant trees, and advocate for climate policies. Learn actionable steps at WWF.

				I'm going to include more hyperlinks and more tips on how we can help.

			<h2>Wireframes</h2>
			<p>
				Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
				here: 
			</p>

			<h3>Home</h3>
			<p>
				The home page on the wireframe may look squished but everything will be properly spaced.

				I'm going to add more ways that we can help the environment. For now I just have the website linked.
